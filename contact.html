<div class="project-content">
    <p class="project-description">
        This project focuses on the design, fabrication, and application of microfluidic devices to culture cancer cells and replicate 
        the tumor microenvironment. Microfluidic platforms offer precise control over fluid flow, nutrient gradients, and chemical 
        concentrations, making them ideal for mimicking the complex conditions in which tumors grow. Through 3D printing and advanced 
        design techniques, we developed devices capable of sustaining cancer cell cultures, providing an environment that closely resembles 
        in vivo tumor settings.
    </p>

    <p class="project-description">
        By engineering different microfluidic patterns and flow dynamics, we explored the interaction of cancer cells with their surrounding 
        environment, including how cells respond to varying nutrient levels and therapeutic agents. This allows for more accurate modeling of 
        drug responses and tumor growth, potentially advancing cancer research beyond traditional 2D cultures. Furthermore, these platforms 
        facilitate the study of cancer cell migration, proliferation, and invasion in a controlled, reproducible manner.
    </p>

    <p class="project-description">
        Our work highlights the importance of integrating bioengineering with cancer biology to develop innovative tools for research. These 
        devices not only provide a powerful platform for studying tumor biology but also pave the way for personalized medicine by testing 
        patient-derived cells in similar microfluidic setups. The project’s outcome contributes to the ongoing effort to bridge the gap 
        between preclinical studies and clinical applications, enhancing the reliability of cancer research and the development of new 
        therapeutic strategies.
