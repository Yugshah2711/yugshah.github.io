        <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
<p class="project-description">
   This study presents an advanced computational model aimed at exploring the intricate dynamics of neuronal activity and calcium homeostasis in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). By integrating inputs from both the central and peripheral nervous systems, this model accurately reflects the complexities associated with the condition. Our research thoroughly examines neuronal excitability, connectivity, and intracellular signaling, revealing the essential role of dopamine in regulating brain circuits. Specifically, it highlights dopamine's impact on motor control and neural communication within the basal ganglia. The loss of dopaminergic neurons characteristic of PD results in considerable disruptions in the functional patterns of critical brain regions, which contributes to classic motor symptoms such as bradykinesia and rigidity. Furthermore, the model emphasizes the importance of calcium regulation, illustrating how its dysregulation can lead to neuronal damage and underscoring the necessity of maintaining calcium balance for optimal brain health. By offering a comprehensive multi-scale perspective on the pathophysiology of PD, this research not only enhances our understanding of the disease but also paves the way for the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These advancements hold the promise of significantly improving treatment modalities and enhancing the quality of life for patients.

        <h3>Figure 1: Basal Ganglia Pathways</h3>
        <p>This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the basal ganglia pathways involved in motor control. It illustrates both the direct and indirect pathways, highlighting the role of key structures such as the substantia nigra, striatum, globus pallidus externus (GPe), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the thalamus. The diagram emphasizes the interactions between excitatory (Glu) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters, along with the modulation by dopamine (DA). Understanding these pathways is crucial for elucidating the dysfunctions that occur in Parkinson's Disease, where the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to significant motor impairments. This visual representation aids in comprehending how disturbances in these circuits contribute to the hallmark symptoms of the disease, including bradykinesia and rigidity.</p>
